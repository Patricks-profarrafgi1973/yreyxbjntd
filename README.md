Oh man, just stumbled out of Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare. What did I just watch? I swear my brain is still spinning, like when you lace your shoes wrong and keep tripping all day. The theater was buzzing, people everywhere, can't shake those popcorn crumbs still sticking in my hoodie. My back is killing me after sitting in those seats like someone folded a chair out of cement and thought Yeah, this'll do.

The scenes. Dude. What was happening? One second it's just Wendy, right, she's like calm and then BOOM - pirates everywhere. And not the fun ones, these are like zombies with swords. Kind of like if a raccoon spent too long in a dumpster and then decided to balance a hat on its head just before a fencing lesson, you know what I mean? Captain Hook was insane this time, his ship's like a crazy hybrid of a rollercoaster and a haunted house.

> Somewhere in there, that moment where Peter's shadow becomes this dark, twisted thing that pretty much tried to eat their happiness. It reminds me of when you download the movie and the file’s all weird and jumpy. Why was Hook whistling that creepy tune though? It got stuck in my head like an unwanted ringtone, or like when you have to pretend to be a plant at a garden party but you're kinda lost because no one gave you the script. Yeah, it’s like that but darker and with more teeth.

I was feeling that background score vibrating like a DJ at a funeral, right, it matched my pounding headache from all the noise in there! Those lost boys, they had this madness in their eyes the whole time, but it was relatable, like you've missed three busses in a row and now you're debating which foot to use to kick the bus stop. Gotta watch the movie again to get a grip on what even happened. How did that crocodile end up there? Faster than waiting forever when they make you tag someone you don't even know at a flea market.

The ending, whoa, can't even piece that together. One minute we're dealing with some emotional face-off and then it's like they threw the script out the window. Absolute chaos, but maybe fun? I'm not sure yet, still processing between rush thoughts and yawns.

I mean, none of it made sense in the best “2 a.m. brainwave” kinda way. It's a brain salad, no dressing, you just dive in with a spoon, hoping it won't bite back. Anyway, download the movie or maybe watch the movie in a setting where your seat won't betray you.
